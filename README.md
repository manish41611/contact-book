# Python-Contact-book-application

This is a Contact List program I created using Python with tkinter module and SQLite3 database.
Includes ability to add, edit, delete a contact with their names, email, phone number and address.
Names are automatically sorted by last name of contact.
Contacts are referenced by unique ID to avoid conflicts with contacts with same names.

TODO:
- add alert notifications for add, edit, delete actions
- field validation and normalization (email, phone number)
- quit button
- search names in contact list

Possible features to add are searching contacts, adding additional fields for home/cell phone numbers.
